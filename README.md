# feel_the_beat
The goal of my project is to make music, an auditory experience, into a multi-sensory experience that can be adapted for any person.  My project incorporates the sense of touch, sound, and sight to make music inclusive to anyone living with a sensory disability at concerts, clubs, or even at home.
